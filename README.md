yo what good my [ninja] this sh[poop]t is a recreation of hakari's domain expansion idle death gamble that you can show to your freinds that are probably animie kids (you are one two for searching this but not me because i just really like jujutsu kaisen and am not a weeb totally non lolololololol)
and claim you made it when you didn't write a single line of code and instead stole from another person who spent ~8 hours also not writing a single line of 
code because we are in an age where we no longer have to write code to make simple programming contraptions and can just spend a long while just asking chat gtp to make individual
blocks of code as you slowly begin to rethink you decisions of having pasions that centered around STEM and are now unsure of which jobs to go to because "oh no what if ai takes my 
job" and "will my degree amount to nothing" or "what degree do i even go to now that ai exist and is only getting faster and better" when you just cling on to the hope that the 
invisible apparent glass ceiling that doesn't allow ai to reach general intelligence for some reason due to a lack of inherent pattern recognition that can vary out of what
it was specifically designed to do such as determing the next cube that will change in x sequence of cubes which any basic human can do but ai can not which hopefully stops ai 
from being able to take all our jobs for just a few more decades just long enough for you to retire or complete enough work in order to be satisfied enough to commit suicide
and not commit it in the chasing of said goals and aspirations which for me are  including but are not limited to
include :becoming a girl,[for legal reasons can not say],[for family reasons such as my family seeing this i can not say],becoming rich,reaching not just the hights but the four
corners of human expierience,other life goals that may range from hedonistic to generous from forgiving to revengful and from peacful to violent,making at least 100k USD a year and living in a third world country such as bali where everything is cheaper and living like a king/queen
and thats about it (seriously to my family and other peers that might be worried about my mental health if you actually knew the extent of my goals becoming a girl would easily be the easiest and least far fetched of them all)
but that all doesn't matter because we have always bet on hakari toca donka domain expansion and that is super mlg pogger skibidi sigma

also a ten reel version
